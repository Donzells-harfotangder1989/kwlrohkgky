Wow, okay, just fresh out of 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Gap and my brain’s a scrambled egg omelette. You know when you just sit in silence, letting the credit roll be your therapist for like, five minutes? That was me. Theater air smells like socks and popcorn sweat> and I dropped my Skittles halfway through. My back feels like I’ve knitted knots instead of sweaters.

I swear the main character, she walks like she’s on a tightroped, but the kind that stretches across an empty pool — that anxious balance act. Felt it in my bones, or maybe it was the bad seat, I really should see a chiro. And that soundtrack? It crawls into your ear like candy before a dentist visit. Just wild.

> Someone asked if you want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 it? Maybe. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   though, it’s like riding a carousel with no music. Just the whirring and creaking. Weird, confusingly sad satisfaction. The climax, oh man, was like trying to tell a dog which way north is — barking with no direction.

Her red shoe, you notice it? They gave it so much airtime I thought it was the secondary cast. Always drawn to red things. I'm like a bull, but like, the slow kind. Awkward guy next to me kept sneezing, hope he’s not flu’ing me. Scene in the cafe, they spill coffee, not sure if it was intentional but everything seems designed to make you feel jittery. Resident chaos.

Did I mention the lighting is like an eclipse party — half light, half you wonder if someone forgot to play the switch game. You can touch the dysfunction with your hands, almost taste it. People say don't trust the itty-bitty details, but the little air conditioner hum beats like my restless heart sometimes.

Is it morning already outside? Everything’s a blur now. Was there even a villain? Just layers of grey, like how mom piles sweaters in winter — toasty and confusing. 

Someone told me they’d 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 it for a rainy day. No idea why that matters now, but okay. Maybe re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 when things clear up in here.
